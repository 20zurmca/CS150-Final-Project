# Project3
Final Project for CS150

This project presented the travelling salesman problem.  The problem asks from a single vertex in a connected graph, what is the shortest path to every other vertex and back.  The context involves coffee shops and warehouses on a 100x100 connected grid (a weighted, directed graph).  The shops and warehouses serve as vertices, and edges connect every shop and warehouse together with weight equal to their distance apart.  The shops have cargo orders that delivery trucks need to satisfy in one day; however, the trucks cannot load past 500 units of cargo.  If the truck does fill up to this capacity, it must return to its originating warehouse.  Each truck must deliver a full cargo-order for a specific cargo; there are five different types of cargo.  The number of trucks per warehouse varies, and there exists one “master warehouse” at the edge of the grid with unlimited trucks.  The objective of the project is to minimize the travelling distance of all trucks while satisfying all the shops. This problem is NP-hard, meaning it cannot be solved in polynomial time.  Thus, I took a greedy approach in solving the problem.  In my analysis, I will analyze the efficiency of my optimization.  My hypothesis is that my solution is efficient in most cases, but not the best.

In my solution, I mapped the shops and warehouses on a weighted, directed graph.  Every shop is connected to every other shop and warehouse with edge weights equal to their total horizontal and vertical separation distance.  Each warehouse as a stack2 of trucks of varying size.  The general idea is that once a truck leaves a warehouse, the truck will go to the closest possible shop and fulfill all its needs possible.  There are three checks that happen before a truck can go to a shop.  First, a truck can only go to a shop if it can fulfill any cargo needs.  Second, the truck can’t go to the same shop twice.  Last, a truck can’t go to a shop where there is a warehouse closer by.  This last condition only applies to trucks that have visited at least one shop, so every warehouse (besides the master one, of course) utilizes all their trucks.  If any of these checks fail, the truck will go to the next closest shop to fulfill those needs.  The truck will continue this algorithm until it is either full or it has seen every prior shop.  Then, it will return to its originating warehouse.  To find the closest shop, I store all neighboring facilities to a given shop in an ArrayList 1 and sort them by edge-weight (distance).  I dispatch one truck at a time, one warehouse at a time, starting with the first warehouse, the second warehouse, and so on to the tenth warehouses.  When the first nine warehouses run out of trucks, I only use the unlimited warehouse for trucks.  Last, I sorted each shop’s cargo order by weight largest to smallest, so each truck will pick up the shops’ largest orders first.
